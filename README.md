# project-euler-zig

My code solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

I've been playing around with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and figured this
would be a great way to learn some of the language.

## usage

You need `zig` installed, of course.

Then,

```sh
# run tests for all solutions
zig build tests

# run tests for a single solution
zig build 1

# run a single solution, printing its results
zig run src/problem_0001.zig
```
