# project-euler-zig

My code solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

I've been playing around with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and figured this
would be a great way to learn some of the language.

## usage

You need `zig` installed, of course.

Then,

```
# test all solutions
zig build

# test an individual solution
zig build test_1

# run an individual solution, printing its results
zig build 1
```
